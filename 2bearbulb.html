                    <h1>BearBulb: Energy Management for Campus Residents</h1>
                    <p><i>Campus residents in the National University of Singapore (NUS) aren't made to pay for utilites by the meter. As a result, heaps of energy is wasted every academic year when residents move back in and shrug at the inconsequential act of leaving their utilities on. BearBulb is a concept for an energy management mobile application for NUS students. It aims to address the problem of using energy utilities irresponsibly in the absence of perceived consequences.</i></p>
                    <p><i>This project was undertaken for partial completion of CS3240 – Interaction Design, the landmark class on UI/UX design hosted by the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.</i></p>

                    <h3>1. Overview</h3>
                    <h4>a. Objective</h4>
                    <p>Conceptualise a product that would address the problem of irresponsible energy wastage by NUS Residents.</p>
                    <h4>b. Approach</h4>
                    <p>This project was done in a team of four researchers and designers. As NUS students ourselves, we were able to sample and interview several NUS residents who were either personal friends or referred contacts. Through an iterative approach, we conducted interviews to locate users' pain points and habits, designed prototypes to test with our users, and conducted contextual inquiries and walkthrough tests with users to design a high-fidelity prototype that might address the identified problem,</p>
                    <h4>c. Duration</h4>
                    <p>September 2018 – November 2018</p>
                    <h4>d. Tools</h4>
                    <p>Pen and paper, Google Slides, Adobe XD</p>
                    <h3>2. Process</h3>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>An iterative approach to user reserach was adopted to ensure that production could be agile, and that users could be kept in close consultation during the design process.</p>
                    <p>NUS residents are typically young, undergraduates, and so we described our users to be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary Demographic</li>
                       <li>
                           <ul>
                            <li>Age: 19 - 29 (Undergraduate and Graduate Students)</li>
                            <li>Gender: All</li>
                            <li>Location: NUS Halls and Residences</li>
                            <li>Occupation: Student</li>
                            <li>Income: ≤ $12,000 / annum</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Secondary Demographic</li>
                            <li>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Age: 40 - 50 (Residential Fellows)</li>
                                <li>Gender: All</li>
                                <li>Location: NUS Halls and Residences</li>
                                <li>Occupation: Academic Faculty and Staff</li>
                                <li>Income: $120,000 - $180,000 / annum</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For our user study, we decided to begin our search with a survey to understand the scope of the problem from a macro point of view. We administerd a survey using Google Forms to find out how much time NUS residents spend on campus, how close they are to their community, how they manage their electrical appliances, and to what extent they feel like saving electricity is important to them.</p>
                    <h5>Survey</h5>
                    <p>We disseminated a survey through our personal contacts, understanding that many of them stay on campus themselves. We collected a total of 127 responses, all of whom stay in an NUS residence. More than 90% of whom are in their NUS residence for at least 5 days a week, and 76.2% of whom spend more than 3 hours interacting with other members of their residence.</p>

                    <img src="images/bearbulb-userstudy1.jpg"   max-width="100%"width="auto" height="auto">
                    <p>Through the survey, we found that many residents do believe that energy conservation is important. However, we also found that many residents don't turn off their appliances when they exit their rooms, with about 11% of them admitting that they never switch off their fan when they exit their room. We also found that 50% of residents visit a common lounge of their residence oless than twice a week. The communal use of common lounge appliances helps to reduce the individual usage of such appliances, especially those that consume a lot of energy, such as air-conditioning.</p>
                            <img src="images/bearbulb-userstudy2.jpg"   max-width="100%"width="auto" height="auto">
                            <img src="images/bearbulb-userstudy3.jpg"   max-width="100%"width="auto" height="auto">
                            <img src="images/bearbulb-userstudy4.jpg"   max-width="100%"width="auto" height="auto">
                    <p>At the end of the survey, we asked respondents if they would be willing to participate in future interviews and usability tests as part of our endeavour. In so doing, we were able to use the demographic, attitudinal and behavioural data from our survey to select appropriate respondents for our user-study.</p>
                    <h4>Interviews</h4>
                    <p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a variety of participants. From our survey, we selected 5 respondents from 3 different residences, who vary in their years of candidature (i.e. we selected 1 year-1 respondent, 2 year-2 respondents, 2 year-3 respodnents, and a final-year undergraduate). As our survey's responses were largely from an undergraduate cohort, we approached a residential fellow personally (convenience sampling) to ask if they would be able to participate in our qualitative interviews. As such, we ensured diversity in our limited sampling.</p>
                    <p>For our qualitative user studies, we expected that most, if not all, participants of the user study would be receptive to the idea of energy saving. However, we found that several participants were hard-headedly opposed to the idea of expending time, effort, and energy towards the cause of saving electricity. Many of them were also resigned and almost unapologetic towards contributing to the problem of wasting energy, which was completely different from our expectations. While we knew that several residents would waste energy, perhaps out of laziness, we did not expect the lack of remorse towards energy wastage that we had in some of our interviews.</p>
                    <p>The responses on social life in residences was extremely illuminating, especially with regard to informing our product’s features. Noticeably, residents of Prince George’s Park do not understand their residential life as one that is shaped socially, although they do have and maintain strong social ties with students who may be from other residences. Residents of Residential Colleges and Halls conversely participate well with their social cohorts. However, there were obvious lines of differentiation – older residents, especially those in their final year – demarcate their social networks very distinctly. It was clear that, for many NUS Residents, socialising was a worthwhile activity, although our participants were selective about who they considered to be part of their active social circle.</p>
                    <p>We identified key quotes and points from our interviews and built an Affinity Diagram with them. With it, we identified underlying and unifying themes that would inform our design process.</p>
                    <h3>3. Affinity Diagram</h3>
                    <div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/bearbulb-affinity.jpg"   max-width="100%"width="auto" height="auto"></div>
                    <p>As evident from our Affinity Diagram, residents are generally deeply involved with their community. This could either be a good or a bad thing, in that the community was seen to be interesting (Theme: Interesting Community Life) and hence, they would spend time and energy getting to know their peers, or in that community can often be divisive, but this was often described while talking about the good things about community (Theme: Divisive Social Culture). In total, residents whom we spoke to are generally involved with their community, and even if they did not spend that much time interacting with their peers, they had a firm understanding of the social environment they were in (Broader Theme: Community Involvement).</p>
                    <p>Some residents expressed their thoughts towards campus life differently, framing it as irrelevant or uninteresting (Theme: Uninteresting Community Life). These respondents notably expressed interest in other aspects of social life, for example Respondent #5 often referred to his friends in his faculty, rather than his residence.</p>
                    <p>Across these themes, a broad significant theme that emerged was that of Resignation (Broader Theme: Resignation). This sense of resignation applied both in nonchalant attitudes towards energy conservation, and in general. While our interviews were meant to touch on residents' energy habits, we also noticed that there was resignation expressed towards community life. For example, one resident, a final-year student, expressed resignation towards having fewer and fewer familiar friends living in campus as not many senior-year undergraduates decide to continue to stay on campus as they progress through their candidature. There was also a resignation towards things that were perceived to be hard to change. Our respondents, whether or not they were aware of the effects of energy wastage, felt that it was not worth caring about because they felt that their individual actions were negligible (hence, "Aware but Don't Care" and "Unaware but Don't Care" arose as themes). It also appeared that their social interactions with their peers in the community were the main reason why some students chose to adopt or avoid energy saving practices. As one of our respondents phrased: </p>
                    <p><i><b>“No. Don’t see why it should be talked about. Factories that consume large amount of energy is more important… My lab lights are never off because there has to be someone around. Even the aircon is turned on. We have no control over it.”</b></i></p>
                    <p>Another student mentioned that if energy saving reminders were relayed through internal chats on Whatsapp or Telegram, they were more likely to be enforced.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we discovered that residents are likely to be creatures of habit (Broader Theme: "Creatures of Habit"). Most of our respondents could tell us with confidence and ease how they are currently spending their time, where they would be in the coming days, and what their forthcoming weeks would be like. Unsurprisingly, respondents found these various habits worth investing in. For example, Respondent #6 was involved in dance practices both in and out of school, for which she found no problem spending an inordinate amount of time and energy, as well as embracing the various communities that similarly partook in the same activities. This reflected well against their energy spending habits as well. Respondent #6, being involved in Hall activities, found it commonsensical to save energy because her peers do. Yet, for Respondent #5, who was more devoted to people outside of his residence, found little reason to feel concerned about matters within his residence, including energy consumption.</p>
                    <p>In total, a grand theme of <b>"Only involved with things perceived to matter"</b> was surfaced. Residents are very cognisant of who, what, and how to invest their time and energy. They involve or absent themselves from social events, indicating their awareness of the social environment they are placed in. Knowing such, they guide their behaviours and habits around what they perceive to be important.</p>
                    <p>Through online surveys and face-to-face interviews with NUS residents, we learnt that while many of our potential users communicate most with their peers from the same residence, some of our initial assumptions didn’t hold — such as the assumption that NUS residents interact most with their level mates. Almost all interviewees who were actively involved with their respective residences expressed disinterest towards their level-mates, reflecting the lack of significance physical neighbours had with each other.</p>

                    <h4>a. Concept</h4>
                    <p>BearBulb aims to make energy usage an issue worth being conscious about. We aimed to do this through two ways: 1) Symbolising energy through affective means, and 2) Make it easy to check energy usage</p>
                    <p>To do this, we proposed that an animal character be created for each user, and that the animal's environment would adjust according to the user's energy usage. Each user is recommended a certain amount of energy dependent on the type of room they stay in. This amount is to be determined by the amount of energy typical room appliances consume, and the survey data we collected.</p>
                    <h4>b. Features</h4>
                            <div style="text-align: center"><img src="images/bearbulb-personalstats.png" max-width="100%" width="auto" height="auto"></div>
                    <p><b>1. Daily View</b></p>
                    <p>Personal energy usage is categorised by "Today", "Week", "Month" and "Semester" tabs. Our respondents informed us that this method of organising time was in line with how they scheduled and organised their habituated routines. Hence, the model of representing information in BearBulb aligns with the mental model that users have of their daily lives.</p>
                    <p>The first tab displays' users' Daily Usage. The first instance of this tab shows a brief overview of their total usage for the day against the recommended amount that they are given.</p>
                    <p>Users are able to then further explore the granular details of their daily use if they would like to. This includes the breakdown of energy usage by appliance, and the amount of energy used by the hour.</p>

                    <p>As we realised that certain users did not particularly care about numerical representations of their energy usage, we used an affective means of doing so – through the cartoon character of a Bear and its habitat. The Yard is the home of every user’s assigned Bear character. Users are able to earn decorative items should they stick to an assigned weekly limit. This limit was calculated from the estimated energy consumption of common electrical appliances as well as the responses that we gathered from our survey. The Yard, then, mirrors the efforts of the user in trying to be pro-environmental with their energy usage habits. The concept of the Yard stems from the idea that making such effects publicly viewable by other users will motivate users to “beautify” their yard – if numerical reasoning cannot motivate some users, then aesthetic and affective ones might.</p>

                    <p>A social leaderbaord was conceptualised and designed based on feedback and other similar applications. Because the affective influence of the yard was a key factor to our application, we made it possible to view other users' Yards using the leaderboard. A rough point system was included to provide numerical structure to the competition.</p>

                    <p>Users would also be given the opportunity to create micro-groups of their own. We discovered from our user interviews that users may or may not have been particularly concerned with their residence. While physically proximate, users would eventually form social circles of their own based on similar interests or other forms of social groupings (e.g. interest groups, sports). This option to identify based on peculiar groupings aligned with the ways in which residents organised their social life.</p>

                    <p>Uniform across all identified users was the need to be able to manage their electrical appliances using their mobile device. IoT management was therefore decided to be the main feature of the application – the first screen that all returning users will be directed to. We also added a simple "IFTTT"-esque feature to automate their connected IoTs. Of course, the ability to control dorm appliances via IoTs is an imagined future (although a very environmentally-friendly one!)</p>
